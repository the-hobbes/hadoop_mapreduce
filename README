To run a local mapreduce pipeline, do the following:

cat testfile.txt | ./mapper_sales_per_category.py | sort | ./reducer_sales_per_category.py

To scp files to the virtual machine;

scp foobar.txt training@192.168.1.11:~/udacity_training/lesson_3

To run full hadoop pipeline on vm (after copying input into hdfs):

hs lesson_3/mapper_sales_per_category.py lesson_3/reducer_sales_per_category.py my_input/ output_dir

(note that the input must already have been put into the my_input dir in hdfs)
